This is the final stage but still important and time consuming as writing up your research may be one of the most difficult tasks of a project. The final report should be concise, good and effective and that is a task in itself. When you start to work on your report, these are some of the general considerations that you must keep in your mind:\r\nYour Readers:  Who is going to be the audience for your report? The content and depth of your report will vary according to the expertise and intellectual capital of your readers and the purpose with which your reader is going to be reading it. Sometimes the audience may just want a summary of results and sometimes you have to write for clearing a PhD exam. Whatever it is, keep your reader in mind.\r\nThe concept: Every research project has a major concept on which the report rests. It is a good idea to weave the concept in the form of a story for the reader to find it engrossing. This is even possible for very formal reports, where a good story line can actually lift up the interest rating of an otherwise dull and boring report. It is a very difficult proposition for a report, which otherwise is filled with facts and findings and you want to tell all those to the reader because you have done a lot of hard work for it. But, if you view the research from the perspective of the audience, you would find it better to let go of some details that may be very dear to you, and find place for them in the technical appendices or tables, if necessary.\r\nFormatting: In the beginning itself, if you are aware and careful about the formatting considerations and guidelines of the university/journal/book for which you are doing the research, then it is easy to get your work accepted. There are examples and stories that tell us, that the best of work was rejected because of poor formatting or labeling done by the writer.\r\nIf you begin the expression of your research, in context to writing, with these aspects kept in mind, it would be easier for you to create a document that would be acceptable and appreciated by all.', '', '', '', '', 0, '2', '1468305626'),

These can often confuse the general populace at large. Therefore, it is imperative to understand oneâ€™s dietary requirements along with a proper understanding of the ailments that require specific treatment and cure. India has a treasure-trove of information in its ancient Vedas; the use of organic foods and medicines that can cure several ailments and diseases are described in detail in the Ayurveda, the popularity of which is catching-up even in the developed countries. Over the centuries, the proponents of Ayurveda have been exalting the use of various herbs and spices along with organic food to bolster the immune system and fight day-to-day ailments and diseases. The modern day-to-day routines and lifestyles have given rise to various novel diseases; some of them include obesity, type-2 diabetes, breathing problems due to pollution and smoking, heart diseases and stroke, gastrointestinal ailments, and the list goes on. Several of these diseases can be easily controlled through proper regimen of exercises and diet control. The efficacy of such regimen can be additionally improved by the addition of organic foods into the diet. For example, the addition of high-fiber food in the diet can aid in digestion and reduction in gastrointestinal issues. Foods such as wheat, corn, and rice bran are superfoods when it comes to dietary fiber. The prevalence and popularity of junk foods has upped the intake of saturated fat, starch, and sugar into the system. One beneficial way to avoid the intake of such foods is to replace them with organic foods. As an instance, when suffering from hunger pangs before or after meals, it is better to fill-up on salads and vegetables rather than processed foods that have a high content of starch- and sugar-laden material. These materials have a tendency to be detrimental to health in the long run. In consultation with a certified dietician, the daily intake requirement of various organic foods can be determined and the diet can be adjusted in accordance with such requirements. This change in routine can go a long way in maintaining a healthy lifestyle by including organic foods in the diet.', '', '', '', '', 0, '2', '1468313941'),

Since it is organic cultivation, pest management is an important aspect to be taken care. Periodical check on the plantâ€™s growth ensures it is free from pest attacks. \nThe three primary macro nutrients which are essential for Plantâ€™s growth are Nitrogen, Phosphate and Phosphorous. Secondary macro nutrients and various micro nutrients are necessary for plants at every stage of its growth. Most of these nutrients are present in soil naturally. Red soil is ideal for vegetable plants. Since, there is a scarcity for red soil and some of the nutrients are missing, we can go for a Pot Mix. The Pot Mix is prepared with a specialized composition of few ingredients to make sure that we have all the macro and micro nutrients sufficient for the growth of the plant. Apart from adding the nutrients to the Pot Mix, we also need to address some of the key issues in the due course of the growth of the plant. This we call as giving supplements through spray. These supplements can be prepared by us naturally which will bond the growth of the plant with the nature.\n\nPlace the pots with the pot mix filled on the terrace.\nYou can use a water proof blanket on the floor, if needed.\nSow the seed, one in a pot. Some vegetables and flowers have to be grown with the help of saplings.\nWater the pots daily either in the morning or in the evening.\nNormally germination of seeds will take place in a weeks time.\nVegetable plants start giving yield from third month onwards and it extends up to 6 months.\nUse bio-pesticides to control pest.\n\n', '1469897890'),

Disturbing stress and anxiety has created an environment full of tension. Instead of going home and venting out the office frustration or traffic jamâ€™s frustration, everybody should train their minds to forget everything that happened outside when they enter their house. Expensive construction material or furniture canâ€™t bring out the happiness that a sheer conversation over a cup of coffee, with our family can bring. It is very important to plant a lot of florae around our homes as nothings can be better than a plant when it comes to offering positivity and happiness! Treating everybody equal and respecting everyoneâ€™s feelings is also very important to stay together happily and calmly. It is should be our responsibility to take out time for our elders as they are the ones who have given us this life, we should never be busy for them at least. They do not value anything more than our time and presence. The place where a family lives should be treated just like a temple. Responsibility of taking care of all the things and materials present inside the house is of everyone and not just a single person. It is very important to throw away everything that is not required as cluster of faulty stuff also brings in a lot of negativity.

Coconut trees growing on gardens have also been sighted.\n       Instead of using portable water you can harvest rain water.It is important to water proof your roof to avoid leakage into your home. You can start planting by using deep pots and avoid using plastic pots as they quickly heat up and do not drain well.One must avoid using garden soil, but use compost rich soil or  quality potting mix.', '1470115026'),

From classic rock and beautiful jazz, we have become obsessed with RnB, hip hop, pop and ridiculously rhyming rap. While the west has been doing rap for quite some time now in the form of acclaimed artists such as Eminem, 50 cents and even the infamous Kanye West, the Indian music scene has just been acclimated to rap music. One of the most famous beacon of Indiaâ€™s rap revolution is the undeniable king of Indian rap â€“ Yo Yo Honey Singh. Love him or hate it, it is downright impossible to ignore him.  So, what makes him really tick? Is he really the misogynist, spoilt brat or perhaps he is just misunderstood? Letâ€™s have a look at his lyrics\n1.	â€œChaar botal vodka, kaam mera roj kaâ€ :\nThis is probably a tribute to all the kabadi walas who work so hard to earn ends meets. Four bootles of vodka and he can probably feed his family well that day. \n2.	â€œKudiye ni tere, brown rang ne,\nMunde patt te ni saare mere town deâ€ :\nRacism is a really big problem in the world. He is just empowering all women of colour in this song.\n3.	â€œYaar tera superstar desi kalakaar\nMain putt jatt da manda ni haarâ€ :\nHe is motivating and encouraging everyone to never give up in life and highlighting the importance of determination and hard work. \n4.	â€œHaan main alcoholic hoonâ€ :\nHe is with satire and subtlety addressing the issue of alcoholism and addiction that is plaguing this country.\nThese are just a few examples. You see, Honey Singh is a true genius and all of us are just misunderstanding him. The poor guy just wants to highlight social issues and make us all more socially aware. \n', '1470116579'),

The fact that there are so many functioning and up-coming start-ups in India today is a sign that the present and future of the country is on the right course. Not just for the economy, the value of start-ups has to be seen in terms of human evolution also, especially in India. \n\nAfter close to 200 years of British domination, a large majority in India had become oriented towards finding employment and then spending the whole productive period of their lives in jobs that they were not passionate about. No wonder, till a few years ago, the employed class in India largely signified lethargy and boredom. \n\nStart-ups are breaking this attitude of find security in a job and then being passively employed for the rest of life. There is a whole new level of risk involved in starting-up. Gladly, the young in India have the courage to take the risk and the necessary planning to defeat the risk. One might argue that a lot many start-ups fail. Well, point taken...however, such people have to be reminded that behind all the inventions and innovations in the world, the instances of failures far outweigh the examples of success. The law of evolution states that collective efforts brings out new changes. The fear of failure is a sure-shot way to fail.\n\nInnovations that have eluded India for so more than a couple of centuries are coming back again, on the shoulders of start-ups. The practice of having a huge monolithic organizations doling out employment to youngsters is quickly being torn apart by start-ups. Start-ups convey a power for small group of individuals to contribute towards the society with new and productive ideas. Start-ups convey that the young in India have taken up the responsibility to have a good life for themselves and provide a worthwhile contribution to their country. The government or large organizations are no longer looked upon by youngsters to shape their lives. And that is the greatest news for a country like ours.\n\nIn the social sector too, start-ups are making things happen. There are start-ups bringing clean electricity to people, start-ups dedicated to reforms in our democratic process, and start-ups manufacturing environment friendly products to replace plastic.\n\nStarts-up signify new energy for India, an energy backed by conviction.

With the nausea almost gone, you can enjoy these last few months including the growing bump that adds to the radiant glow on your face. While it is time to plan that much awaited nursery, it is important to not forget that these last weeks are very crucial to your baby\'s health.\n\n1. Count the Kicks: Well, not quite literally if you haven\'t been advised to do by your OB/GYN. But by now you should be able to feel movements and sudden kicks as the baby gains in weight and strength inside you. It is a good idea to keep track of the movements during the day.\n\n2. Appointments: The third trimester sometimes makes the body go a bit topsy-turvy. A lot of women develop gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia during these last few weeks. It is important for you to discuss with your healthcare provider in detail should you have a history of such complications. Keep a check on your antenatal appointments and tests and watch out for anything that is out of the normal for you.\n\n3. Ultrasounds: With the weeks progressing, a lot of the focus moves to the foetal development and you will have to keep a tab on all your appointments. With one happening almost every week, it requires some amount of management especially if you are working or have children. Make necessary arrangements to avoid last minute hassles. Nobody wants you to miss those precious ultrasound appointments.\n\n4. Travel: Once you are in the last trimester, it is advisable to not travel long distance. Do not plan a move during these last months, especially if you have been categorised for a high-risk pregnancy.\n\n5. Eat Healthy: The one thing that you really want to do is gorge on food. Of course, the baby is making you hungry but for sure you donâ€™t need those fatty foods. Eat salads, go for a sandwich and milk instead of high sugar content drinks and desserts.\n\nThis is the best time of your pregnancy when you are looking forward to that little bundle of joy that you so wished for. So take care and go ahead and plan that beautiful Baby Shower you always wanted.\n', '1471667119'),

Is this how you want to travel? No, right? \nAn ideal travelling bag is one which is light but still has all the necessary goods that your require, basically just essentials. Always remember, that you are going to travel and you will come back home, so you donâ€™t need to pack your entire home in your one suitcase. Just take only the necessities and you are good to go.\nNow what all do you exactly need?\n1. Clothes: That is the first thing that you pack. Hereâ€™s a quick tip to make some extra room in your suitcase, instead of just throwing in your clothes or stacking them up, roll them up and place them side by side. This way, your clothes not only stay wrinkle free but also save space.\n2.  Shoes and Socks: Since you know you would need socks along with your shoes, why not put them inside the shoes and save space? All you need is shoe bag to place your shoes, to avoid soiling your clothes.\n3.  Makeup: Prepare a pouch and place it in a corner between the suitcase and your clothes. \n4.  Medicines: Just a few medicines for headache, nausea, loose motions, here you can apply your logic of â€˜just in caseâ€™\n5.  Chargers: Neatly fold the wire and keep it in a pouch and place it anywhere in your suitcase.\n6.  Toiletries: Again, all you need is a pouch to keep all your stuff together and in one place.\n7.

The worth of your trip is decided by your experiences and not your possessions. If you are an avid traveler, you probably don\'t need me to tell you this. Speaking of worth, first things first, rule out the worthless. No matter how much you love that black coat with heavy fur, you cant take it out to Miami. Know your destination and pack according to the climate!\n\nClothes, I believe should be given the least amount of importance when packing your bags. Throw in a few anywhere-everywhere tops, SURE! But remember the key word:FEW. Most of us get carried away while packing, wishful thinking about a potential encounter with THE ONE. Ahem Ahem, sorry to break your bubble, your bag does not have space for your fantasies. A decent rucksack with wheels is the most convenient option, if you plan month long trips. Its not so much about the kind of bag you carry, as much it is about how you pack it. Get your planner in place buddy, you\'ll need a checklist.   \n\nRoll your socks put them into that one good pair of shoes you plan to carry(but not actually use); make a pouch for your toiletries, another one for make up and if I may add without sounding like a mother, A FIRST AID KIT! Then of course follows the traveler\'s gear. Your camera, diary, water flask, binoculars,( I don\'t really get that one; what? are you gonna peep into strangers windowsjQuery111005695922128082365_1471961388367! ) passport and money or cheques (Try keeping this in a not-so-obviously fat wallet ...) etc.\n\nWhile I have ignored getting too much into clothes, don\'t underestimate your luck :P carry at least one dress that makes you look DROP-DEAD-GORGEOUS.. Every day of your trip won\'t necessarily be sunny and bright. You might want to doll up, just for some ego-validation if not anything else ;) An organised bag reflects an organised mind ... So ensure that you give your loyal travel companion its due importance!\n\n  \n\n\n', '1471963106'),

Get a tinted moisturizer with sunscreenâ€”you can reapply it over your foundation without messing up your makeup and it\'ll actually make your skin look better. \nGet a sheet mask -Sheet masks are shaped like a face and infused with moisturizer. You can also make your own sheet mask when you want a quick glow by soaking a cotton cloth in a moisturizing serum or essence. \nSupplement your skin care - Your skin uses omega fatty acids to create natural moisturizing oils. \nBe a clean freak - At the very least, use cleansing wipes before bed; if you don\'t take off your makeup, it can trap aging free radicals against your skin overnight. \nSo the mantra is to pay attention, look beautiful!', '1472119325'),

The funding for conducting research is quite capped to the national fellowships, and unfortunately, the numbers are very few. Also, there is a continuous tendency of the faculty members to behave with the PhD students who are having fellowships, in a way as if they are their personal assistants. Also, the funds required for the requisite traveling for the significant conferences is quite out of one\'s set budget limit. It might be the case that in later stages of the research, the reimbursement will be done by a grant, but in most of the cases, that does not happen. Also, it might be found that many departments do not have the requisite environment for conducting research. In India, PhD is considered to be like a salaried job. However, in other countries, thatâ€™s not the case. The students usually do not tend to commence their PhDs without the availability of proper funding, at least, to maintain a minimum standard of living and other facilities like lab, etc. Most universities in the west dedicate their funds to initiate, at least the partial reimbursement of the travel costs. These favorable factors really encourage people to come forward and pursue a PHD. However, in India, the students get no or minimal support and therefore, feel reluctant to pursue it.', '1472210664'),

A house becomes a home only with the people and the personal things that go inside it, things of unimaginable sentimental value. These things can be as simple as an old lamp or a clock, but the feeling behind them gives your house a touch of home. We here list some of the most important things which you should consider so that your house can become a home. \n1.) Lighting \nLighting is a very powerful tool that can be used to create different illusions and give a character to a particular area of your house. There are areas such as study which requires moderate amount of lighting, while other areas such as the living room can be experimented with different types and intensities of lighting. Different types of lamps and chandeliers give a substance to the painted walls and can be beautifully manipulated to bring out the right colors. You can also create your own lamps and devices so that you can give them your personal touch, making them even more special. \n\n2.)  Storage\nThere are many things that we stop using over the course of time. But these things have a sentimental value which does not allow us to throw them away. If a house does not have a proper storage area, these things lay around the house and create a ruckus in your daily life. Also there are things that you might require once in a while and would be just taking up space the rest of time, such as a camping tents etc. Hence, it is advisable to have a proper storage area in your house so that these things can be stored separately. They should not create an problem in your daily life and be nearby as well.', '1472332780'),

I feel more heartbroken when he recieves enormous support from the croud. Sometimes it\'s like hearing a joke which has been played with a set tempo. It is that hillarious at times, there used to be a time when a song meant something, the lyrics were blissfull, meaningful or inspirational. But then the tragical, 21st century hit the music industry with artists like honey singh, badshah, raftaar, to name a few. Not only the true music lovers get disheartened by hearing those masterpieces created by Honey Singh and company, but also the young and aspiring lyricists and singers who think that a music track is masterpiece, created by hard put in efforts of several artists consolidating their talents. The lyrics are so pukish that it is always better to switch the cannel, but to add on to your misery, he is everywhere, you cant escape this demon of ignorance. Ignorance about the music and the more essentially the lyrics which is the soul of any music track. It seems like he generates lyrics only when he is conspitated or when he is high on some recreational drug. If you were given a hard copy of the lyrics of some Honey Singh track and asked to rearrange them from the start, it would be somewhat impossible for you or might take around infinity to do the same.

Here are few tips that definitely come handy when you want an amazing terrace garden.\nâ€¢	Start with the location:\nIdentify if your house is fit for experimenting with all kinds of plants. For the sturdy buildings, even the trees are perfect for terrace gardening. Spread soil over a small portion the terrace and start planting in this lawn. A waterproof terrace is mandatory to avoid any leakage. If you are not confident about these things, simply use small pots to plants herbs and small plants. For the beginners, they are foolproof ideas. \nâ€¢	Soil nutrition:\nIdentify the plants you like to grow, and get to know what type of soil and nutrients are required for the plants you choose. At times, mixture of soils is required for certain type of plants. Various online sources are handy to know the nuances in choosing the soil type. Also, use compost to ensure healthy plants.

In a week, manure is ready for the terrace garden.\nâ€¢	Choose the plants:\nWhile, the beautiful flowering plants are really alluring, and offer additional benefits of aromatherapy, they are not novice terrace gardeners. You need to ensure that your first yield is successful, so that you do not quit halfway. Try growing herbs like parsley, plants like tomatoes, chillies, carrots, and onions.

In the urban concrete jungles of today most people live in tiny houses which don\'t have enough space to cultivate a proper front garden, but a simple and effective means to overcome that issue is a terrace garden. Following is a short guide on how to set up your very own terrace garden:\n-For starters, you have to get your hands dirty to clear out and allocate a proper space on your terrace for a garden.\n-If you\'re a beginner it is strongly advisable that you take it slow and start with growing things you need. \n-Try to maintain a dairy and keep notes of when all the plants were sowed and keep a tab on their progress.\n-Always use a pair of gloves while working with soil to avoid infections.\n-If you don\'t know what plants to grow, do some research on the internet and find the plants that are best suited to the climate.\n-Make sure that the space allocated to the garden receives plenty of sunlight throughout the day.\n-Water your plants every other day and try not to over-water or under-water the plants.\n-Take some time out to tend to the plants by adding fertilizers to the soil, if needed and pruning the plants, when necessary.\nIf you diligently follow the steps above you\'ll soon have a place where you can relax and unwind after a tiring week. If you happen to plant fruits or vegetables you\'ll also be able to grow your own nutrition rich organic produce. \n', '1472403097'),

Not that it has a hundred percent success rate but, people with ideas that speak creatively and are for the welfare of masses, doing undoubtedly good. Like every coin has two faces, this also does. What is happening is that the youth is fed up and wants to change the system. The system where people are hesitant to take a risk. To shut out the old norms and fight for a job, they use their unique ideas to achieve the goals and make dreams come true. Not just for themselves, but many. The Youth is fighting for improvisation. Start Up India has given a chance to these young people to be the faces of a reformed and more rational nation. The need of the hour is to promote, preach and push the right ideas in the right direction. The youth of India today supports start-up because it is giving them the freedom to express their ideas. When the youth decides to make India as incredible as it is, the good days are not behind. For a country like ours, which is developing and growing, small things make a big difference. The youth is powerful they are the future and their thoughts are valuable. So let them build the country they reside in with hopes they live with at all times.

Which would be the right option for my family? Does going the organic way really help? Those sticking to the traditional pot seem to be doing just fine after all, notwithstanding the naysayers. Some people blessed with that rare luxury in Indian home nowadays - a terrace - seem to have found the perfect solution - creating a home plantation for their produce needs. \nThere are, however, a few things one needs to keep in mind while deciding to take matters into their own hands. After all, it is not an easy endeavour and it requires constant upkeep and attention. If the right care is taken, almost anything can be grown on the terrace, including medium sized trees, which a roof can usually support easily. The first step, thus, is to get the right space for your plants. This can be done by covering the entire or a section of the roof with soil (in which case you shall need to waterproof the roof so as to prevent leakages into your own home). In case you are going for the traditional way - with pots, there is no need for any extra effort to be taken. \nThe second step is selecting the right soil for the kind of plants you want to grow. Traditionally, the right mix comprises regular soil typical of the area (for example, black soil in Maharashtra, red laterite in coastal Karnataka), compost coir peat, sand and vermicompost in almost equal proportions. In addition to this, compost needs to be added every week, especially after heavy showers as essential nutrients tend to be washed away by the rains. \nIt is advisable to start with a medium-sized pot and one easy-to-grow plant if you are a first-time gardener.  Tomatoes and chillies are some plants which can be easily cultivated on a terrace plantation and thus should be selected first. Above all, constant care and a little bit of patience are needed for your little project to bloom. \nA few other important points one must remember is the quantity of sunlight reaching the plants - there are some which prefer flourishing in the shade and some that need the direct blast of the sun. Watering twice a day, but not in direct sunlight is very important. One easy way of checking if your garden has enough moisture is pressing the soil with your hands. \nKeeping these little things in mind, your home plantation should be up and coming within a couple of months. \n', '1472445041'),

This dream is envisioned by ever young lad/ lady who sits confined in the four walls of a Bachelors\' degree. We have umpteen number of colleges and recognized universities offering different PhD courses. But then comes the question, is it truly worth the effort in a country like India?\nWith all the patriotism we nurture in our hearts, it is rather dismal to state that it might just be a waste of all endeavor.  The amount of dedication and hard work put into acquiring this degree, is but little awarded in a country like ours. Ranging from pay scales to proposals, either way it\'s a folly. Youth seeking a PhD are shuddered back to reality when they see a corrupt educational system or have to apply for a students visa. The irony of this is that India wants to compare itself to gigantic countries. Yet, the perseverance to build the same does not ignite those concerned in the Education Department. With the responsibilities that burden the shoulders of our youth and the impending poverty and \'rats race\', spending a couple more years pursuing a degree is bursting one\'s bubble.\nUntil India measures its aptitude for progress, it would be futile to look forward to such refine skill.

It is in light of this that PM Narendra Modi has kicked off some ambitious initiatives like the Startup India and Make in India. Till now our education system has been mainly job seeking in nature and there are very few who are ready to take the risk and start something of their own. In a big country like India, which has one of the largest youth populations in the world this approach is perhaps deadly. For any economy to grow there is need of more production as manufacturing is a sector which generates more employment resulting in growth. Indiaâ€™s economy has been mainly driven by services sector and services alone canâ€™t help India to fulfil its ambition of becoming a power in this century.  The Startup India Movement by the Government aims to fill gaps this gap in the economy. Along with the growth it aims for development of start-ups. This initiative is noble in a way that it will make it possible to develop start-ups at grassroots level. \nAt present there are not much jobs in the market due to global recession and we canâ€™t rely completely on the foreign companies to provide employment to our youth. These foreign entities are here to make only profits and at times when there is some problem they just sack n number of employees rendering them helpless. The answer to the employment problem of youth is to empower them to be entrepreneurs and the unveiling of Startup India by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a step in that very direction. The facilitating of a start-up by government would bring confidence among the youth and many would be motivated to join the movement. There is no dearth of talent in a multi-diversity country like India where people are famous for so called jugads (temporary solutions) that are so simple yet are according to the local needs for example a 14 year girl invented a washing machine that runs by paddling like a cycle. She did so because her mother fell ill and she had little time to give to household work as had to spend around two hours to reach school and she surely did wish to leave school. The Startup India will make patenting for inventions easy and simple and no entrepreneur would lose his or her ideas to any other. I am sure the coming years will see more of young Indian entrepreneurs because of this unique yet timely initiative by the government.\n', '1472555166'),

Disquieting stress and anxiety has created an environment full of tension. Instead of going home and venting out the officeâ€™s frustration or traffic jamâ€™s frustration, everybody should train their minds to forget everything that happened outside when they enter their house. Exquisite interiors or furniture canâ€™t bring out the happiness that a sheer conversation over a cup of coffee, with our family can bring. It is very important to plant a lot of trees around our homes as nothing can be better than a plant when it comes to offering positivity and happiness! Treating everybody equal and respecting everyoneâ€™s feelings is also very important to stay together, happily and calmly. It should be our responsibility to take out time for our elders as they are the ones who have given us this life, we should never be busy for them at least. They do not value anything more than our time and presence. The place where a family lives should be treated just like a temple. Responsibility of taking care of all the things and materials present inside the house is of everyone and not just a single person.

Your plants need up to nine hours of sunlight but if you are unable to provide, no worries! there are variety of plants that grow even in shade. Be open to new decision and choices and also be creative with your space but hold in mind what kind of plants you wish to have. \n2. Plants.\n      Choose what kind of plants you want to have. Would you like annuals or perennials? annuals require you to replant once every year while perennials have a shorter blooming period but only need to be planted once. Choose on whether you would like to have a flower garden or a vegetable garden. Vegetables like cucumbers, lettuce and peppers are easy to grow and make it ideal for beginners to work with.

Planting your plant. \n             The big step now is to wait until the soil is prepped and now you can begin to plant your garden. It is common to buy a sapling or a transplant  from the nursery plants and plant them in your garden but if you want to be raw, then you can grow them from the seed. Take care when handling the plants and keep an eye on them. They are your babies after all!\n\n5. Water.\n          Water them only until the ground is moist but not wet. Over watering them can rot the plant while under watering them will wither the plants away. Watch for sign your plants give on how you water. if you see your plants turning yellow around the edges of its leaves then you are under watering it. For better results, water your plants in the early hours of day. \n\nPlants need tender care and must be carefully attended to. But when they do blossom out it will all be worth it. ', '1472705769'),

What is under your feet matters a lot, there is different marble flooring in my drawing room and bedroom and I felt entirely different in both place. She wiped the floor and rolled the carpet all over and installed it to the all corners.\nLightning and storage- Not all apartments install the lights everywhere and especially if it is old, lightening brings new touchÃ© to interiors. i.e. a study room needs a moderate level of light which do not strain the eyes.

Even if you manage to gather finances to buy a house, no one today has the leisure or the mindset to give the house the homely touch. Most people hire an interior designer to make the house attractive. But a house decorated by a professional never becomes a home.\n\nHere are some simple ways in which you can make your house a home without spending a fortune:\n\nClean and Green\n\nA house that is clean is surely a healthy place to live in. Pick furniture that can be easily dismantled when you want to do a thorough cleaning of your home. Leave your hall spacious and simple.\nThe green touches give your home the natural grace. You may opt for simple plants that you may grow in your balcony. You may also pick plants that can be a part of the living room decor.\n\nReinvent the wheel\n\nAs with fashion, even the home decor trends repeat at regular intervals. So choose the decor style from the seventies and the eighties. If by chance you have the record player or gramophone your grandfather used, you may now use it as a part of your home decor. \n\nAvoid being pompous\n\nSpending on extremely luxurious decor items simply means wastage of money. A better way is to reason out how to decorate your home with waste. The bottles of old monk from your last party may as well be your stylish lampshade for the guest room.\n\nHave The Courage To Be Different \n\nYou do not need to decorate your home in a certain way just because everyone else is doing it. You need to use your head. If you like your room to be simple, keep it simple.\n\nSpend on carpets and floor coverings\n\nCarpets may seem like an unnecessary expense in the beginning. But a few carpets can help prevent your floor from getting damaged. The Arabian carpets also help to create a darbar ambience that is perfect for family get togethers.\n\nA house becomes a home with people. So take time to organise family get togethers and festivals.

A PhD is an option one should go for if only one is dynamic and self-motivated and wish to participate in the nationâ€™s development. A countryâ€™s progress is always linked to the research in scientific, economic and even humanitarian fields. \nIt may sound very harsh, but the reality is that it is not worth doing a PhD in India. The foremost reason for this observation is that in India, PhD is mostly done to get a job in the academic field. There are very few people with research oriented mindset who pursue it. \nPeople have the tendency to reach heights of success just by manipulating others and showcasing how â€œimportant\" they are for the team. No matter how much knowledgeable one is, it won\'t make a difference, because no one really cares that. All it matters is oneâ€™s connections that will give you a good appraisal, a good career growth or probably an on-site opportunity.\nIn the field of pure sciences, the funding and infrastructure is inadequate for pursuing the PhD. Even if a person is interested, there is limited access to libraries and even more limited access to journals.\nThe funding for doing research is limited to the national fellowships, which are unfortunately too few. The faculty also has the tendency to treat PhD students with fellowships as their personal assistants and they exploit them to the fullest. Funding for travel to conferences and the like is out of one\'s own pocket. It may be reimbursed by a grant later, but most of the time it is rejected with wierd excuses. One will find many departments in the universities have no real research environment.\n\n\n', '1496767193'),

A woman in her twenties is a girl who is grown up enough to understand about her surroundings, her ambitions in life, what she wants etc. However, one important aspect that everyone misses out is the way a grown up girls dresses in modern India. in their twenties, most of the girls are college goers and office goers. They are often seen wearing Jeans, tops, shrugs and with so many options available around, it\'s up to their choice about wearing a dress. However, what is important is to understand the way the girls style themselves. \n\nEvery girl wants to look the best when they step out of their home and to look presentable they often make mistakes while selecting a dress to wear. Therefore, it is important for them to understand what suits  their personality and what doesn\'t. Everyone has their own personality which means that if you see someone wearing a particular dress, doesn\'t always mean that it will suit us too. Wear dresses that enhances your personality, makes you look comfortable yet trendy as well as presentable. \n\nThere are few must have things to be in your wardrobe. These are the things that suit everyone according to their personality such as a blue denim, a white shirt, a Little Black Dress, a pair of white sneakers, a pair of stilettos and a pair of flats. However, I am not saying that there can\'t be anything else as a wardrobe essential but owning these things can save you anytime without thinking much. One most important thing to keep in mind while styling yourself is that you must wear comfortable clothes. If you don\'t feel comfortable wearing a particular dress, you won\'t be able to do justice to your personality in order to carry it off well. Also, it affects your confidence level and everything else about you.\n\none more misconception we have is branded dresses are always good and not others. There is no doubt that branded clothes are very good quality and durable but that doesn\'t mean that you cannot buy non branded clothes. And mostly, not everyone can afford the branded dresses and it\'s better to go with a non-branded dress if you feel you are comfortable wearing it and the stuff feels good. Apart form these, one more thing you need to keep in mind while shopping for dresses is that fashion for everyone is different. If you can pull off a dress well, you can wear it. You can also wear clothes by mix-n-match. Teaming up a long skirt with a t-shirt and an ethnic shrug, pairing a denim pant or skirt with some traditional top etc. \n\nSo, it\'s all about confidence of pulling off a dress well and you can be as stylish and presentable as you want to be.

If you are tired of applying lipstick again and again and want it to last long, this tip is just for you. Why not try a matte finish? Place a tissue over the lips and after that, dust some talcum powder. You can use a brush for this. \n2.	Make use of lash curlers. Majority of the girls get super-scared to apply eyeliners. This is because either the hands are shaky or because the eyes donâ€™t match. Use lash curlers for drawing an outline; after this, applying eyeliners should be quick and easy. \n3.	Eye shadows must be used as eye liners. Firstly, take some saline solution. After dipping the brush in it, dip it into the eye shadow. Whoa! You are done and your friends might feel you have too many shades. \n4.	Tired of removing your glitter nailpaint? First, apply a coat of glue and then apply the glitter nailpaint. While removing it, you can see how easily it comes off.\n5.	Want to have wide eyes? Try sweeping the mascara in the direction of your nose. Donâ€™t do it upwards, as it might spoil the look. \n6.	Intensify the color of eye-shadows. Firstly, apply white eyeliner over your eyes and after that, apply your favorite eye shadow. This will help in highlighting the color. \n7.	Facing troubles in applying eyelash glue? Well, seek the help of a bobby pin. When a bobby pinâ€™s tip is used for the application of glue, you will see the neatness.\n8.	Do-It yourself lip gloss. Crush eye shadows and add petroleum jelly! This will give you your favorite lip gloss. \n9.	 If a mascara dries up, donâ€™t throw it away. Mix it with saline solution and it will become new as ever.\n10.	Want to get that perfect blotting makeup? Well, you need to use toilet papers for that. \n', '1497007117'),

A home is where there is love, peace and care. It is a space, away from the hustle and bustle of life, where you can be at ease and relax.  To create this secluded place for yourself you need to most importantly invest in love. A home doesn\'t mean quiet and calm. It is a place that will be filled with the cries of kids, the noise of pets and at times quarrels between members of the family. But underneath all, there will always be understanding and tolerance. Bursts of laughter and sprouts of tears wrapped in a film of love will make your house a perfect home and not the material things that go to make the structure. \n\nCare for the needs of every member of your family so that everyone feels loved and valued. Keep a time of the day especially for the family when the entire family can sit and share their thoughts together.  Further, make special rituals to follow at home so that you can cherish them for a lifetime of memories. Whatever be the scenario, always keep that thread of respect intact between all members.It simply needs a little sensitivity, care and warmth to transform a house into a home. \n\nKeep smiling and exuding a positive aura, you will hardly realize when the four walls of your house will turn into your \"home sweet home\".', '1497243471'),

This growth has brought in individuals from all parts of the country to the city and transformed the town which was once famously known as pensioners paradise into a thriving metropolis. This unprecedented growth has also resulted into establishment of IT clusters which are home to most of the prominent IT companies in Bangalore. Most of these companies are primarily clustered in and around Electronic City and Whitefield. Among these two areas, Electronic City which is located in South Bangalore boasts most of the blue chip IT giants like Infosys, Wipro, HCL, Accenture, HP etc. \nThis has led to lot of demand for residential properties in South Bangalore areas which surround Electronic City, like BTM Layout, Jayanagar, House Road, HSR Layout, Darja our Road etc. All the leading developers in Bangalore like Prestige, Brigade Group, Sobha, Purvankara etc have been very active in South Bangalore region in building residential properties for diverse range of budgets to be able to fit needs and requirements of all individuals. \nIn order to buy a residential property in South Bangalore, one needs to keep following points in mind:\nâ€¢	Be clear about the exact location of current/ future work place along with area where individual wants to stay. \nâ€¢	Distance between work place and home by road and metro connectivity (in near future) should also be kept in mind. \nâ€¢	Individuals with young kids should check the schools which are located in area to facilitate easy movement of kids to the school. \nâ€¢	A 4 lane express way connects Silkboard junction to both phases of Electronic city. Proximity  express way is another important factor which should be considered. \nâ€¢	Properties along Hosur Road after Electronic City tend to be relatively cheaper,  they can be considered by individuals on relatively tighter budget.\nâ€¢	Jayanagar and BTM Layout are considered as costlier areas as they are well established and they fall in ring road. Buying property in those areas doesnâ€™t provide right value for money. \n\nKeeping these factors in mind will definitely help any individual seeking to buy a property in South Bangalore. \n', '1497355018'),

Most of the women and even men of today spend ample time within the kitchen. But the Indian Kitchen is not just a place for cooking and baking, it is also a place wherein many other activities take place such as cutting, chopping, dicing, mixing, fermenting etc. It can also be cumbersome at times to work there without certain basic precautions. So below is a list of 5 life hacks, most suitable for the Indian kitchen-\n1.	Getting rid of Garlic Smell\nGarlic is an essential ingredient in the Indian Kitchen, which is used in several dishes. But getting rid of the smell of garlic post a peeling session can be quite annoying, no matter how much you wash your hands with soap. So a simple and fast way to get rid of it is to scrub a bit of used lemon on your palm and fingers and rinse it off after 5 minutes\n2.	Keeping Knives handy and safe\nKnives always pose a danger to not just children but also adults in the kitchen. So the best way to keep them is to stack them up in a wooden knife box with hooves away from the reach of children\n3.	Peeling Citrus Fruits\nSince the skin of citrus fruits like oranges can be really hard, they can be really tough to peel. Hence just roll it over a few times on the kitchen counter which will loosen the skin and you can easily peel it off.\n4.	Peeling Boiled Eggs\nYou may have noticed that hard-boiled eggs are often difficult to peel. So the solution to this is that once the eggs are properly boiled, simply strain the boiling water and run the eggs under cool water, making the insides of the eggs harder and hence the skin easier to remove.\n5.	Cleaning Up\nIt is often tiring to wash your hands repeatedly and running to the room or toilet to wipe your hands dry or cleaning up oil spills. To save time and hassle, take a hanger, cut the lower part of it, insert a paper towel roll and voila itâ€™s ready to be pulled and used instantly.\nSo hope that with these tips working in the kitchen becomes easier and hassle-free for you!', '1498206962'),

Plus, the ban on beef has made the prices of vegetables rise like never before! The wisest way in this scenario would be to get your hands dirty and grow your own vegetables. Yes, friends, we need to start doing it sooner or later. Here is an easy step to push you back into civilization and dig out the â€œNeanderthal Manâ€ in you.\nStep 1: Prepare yourself psychologically.\nThatâ€™s the most important part of all. If you keep thinking that gardening is a thing of the old or a dirty menial job to be done by the illiterate peasants, you can bid farewell to this beautiful and pleasurable experience. Farming was amongst the first occupations that human beings adopted preceded only by hunting. Agricultural projects have now become into the most sought out projects for researchers as well as scientists. Hence, it is no rocket science and neither is it the profession of the poor. Get yourself ready to enjoy a new, experimental journey which will take you from the past to the future. \nStep 2: Make a list.\nEverything you plan to do: till, sow, grow or reap â€“ write it down. Make a step by step plan of what you are going to do and also keep options for any wayward incident. Start growing simple leafy vegetables like spinach, fenugreek, coriander, etc. You can move to the more difficult ones later.\nStep 3: Select a proper farm.\nSo dear farmer, itâ€™s important to have a farm. Select a space that is exposed to sunlight but not to rodents, birds or insects. It can be your terrace or front porch. Optionally you can build a mound around your farm with wood or iron. Ensure that your garden is safe even before it comes into creation. Remember that plants are like human beings, too much of scorching heat, overdose of rains or winds will make them ill. So, find a place where your dear saplings are both safe as well as open. \nStep 4: Pots!\nContainers, any quality or material will do. Old plastic cans or pots may qualify for your task. Cut the containers to the right size and fill them with mud. Do not fill them to the brim as it may lead to dirt in your backyard.\nStep 5: Food for your plant!\nPlants need manure and you must know (as a good farmer ;) what your veggies feed upon. Keep a stock of manure and remember to administer them on time. Donâ€™t forget to buy the right tools for tilling and harvesting. For a good crop, you need to attend to your plants daily.\nIt is indeed a great pleasure to have your own home garden. Many people spend hours tending to their plants. Besides being a creative and fruitful hobby, gardening also serves as a stress reliever and health booster. So, GO GREEN!!\n', '1498394226'),

Accordingly, start-ups that have lasted for seven years and more do not need to pay taxes in the first three years of their existence. Furthermore, start-ups are under no obligation to furnish paperwork such as letters of recommendation from an industry association or start-up incubators to leverage tax benefits. Promoting the start-up scene is all about creating jobs, wealth and better GDP for India.  \nUnder â€œThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill 2015â€, Modi government has also allowed a faster exit for start-ups in case of failures.

There are thousands of applicants for a handful of seats, and for an average student the chances of acquiring a seat into an acceptably decent institution are extremely low. \n\nFurthermore, even if one manages to gain admittance into such a course, the facilities and curriculum provided by most institutions in our country do not meet global standards.\n\nEven in terms of pay scale, India is one of the lowest ranked countries globally for PhD-holders. Another reason why most students prefer to travel internationally for PhDs is because there is a lot of Government intereference when it comes to research. More importantly, the Government does not support-monetarily as well as infrastructurally- PhD research as much as international institutions do. \n\nAnother important reason is that one is also more likely to get a job in India after doing research in a foreign university, but securing a job in another country after acquiring a PhD in India is extremely difficult.\n\nThe number of brilliant academicians in our country is regrettably low, due to the fact that they are not provided adequate support or incentives to conduct research in India. \n\nAll in all, one is much better off pursuing a PhD from an international institution. May it be in terms of infrastructure, or the sheer encouragement which one will face, India is sadly behind the global standards for PhD aspirants. ', '1499264007'),

For some pursuing in India or abroad does not make any difference, especially when this program depends on the knowledge accessible through the internet. While, for others the foreign universities have not only the state of the art technology but also guides and readers with tons of experience and knowledge. There would be still others  that would say that we need to stay in India and do something good for India and so it is better to pursue PhD in India and especially when the subject matter relates to India and its culture. \n\nFurther, it cannot be denied that when it comes to research, filing of patent and trademark, and even royalty for any invention, India is too far behind the developed countries. When it comes to PhD in technical field, it is also known that any technocrat can capitalize on his education and experience more in the developed countries than in India. When money is the bait, the foreign PhD would always out beat any Indian institution except for the IITs and IIMs. It is also known that a PhD abroad is always more practical oriented that the same program in India. This can also be attributed to the corruption and malpractices going rampant in many universities of India. So much so, that there have be PhD candidates who have neither been able to present their thesis properly not even able to answer the questions about the matter they have presented in their thesis.\n\nThus, it depends on oneâ€™s preferences whether to pursue PhD in India, abroad, or even pursue it abroad and return to India.

While convenience has taken centre stage, the novelty has gone out of the window and anticipation levels have somewhat finished.\n\nHowever even if the travel exists either the traditional or the modern way one thing remains common and that it the travel bag. \n\nScarcely do we end up travelling light unless the heavy travel bag entails additional weight charges at the airport and even then do people end up paying by virtue of excess weight that the ultimately end up carrying.\n\nThere isn\'t much to discuss here really. It always pays to carry the essentials. The clothes to last the duration, the medicines, hobby articles (books are music set) and toiletries if at all.\n\nIn case you are fussy about food then may be a component be dedicated to it but otherwise it is always best to embrace the culture of the place one goes to, to try out local food and get mixed amongst the locals.

And if you\'re someone who loves gardening, living in the city can seem a crushing factor for your home-garden dreams. However, the truth is that you can have a garden anywhere, no matter where it is you live. All you\'ll really need is a small area that receives regular sunlight.\nMost likely, you\'ll be living in an apartment. So the best place to set up your own home plantation is on the terrace or your balcony. The space here might be small, but it\'s still plenty enough for a garden.\nSo, if this is your first time setting up a terrace garden, here\'s what you\'ll need:\n1. Containers to hold your plants. (It can be the traditional flower pots or even an old shoe. Plants aren\'t picky about what they grow in. just make sure they have holes at the bottom for the excess water to drain.)\n2. Soil. (Regular red soil or garden soil will do. Asking a nearby nursery or neighbour who has his/her own garden for some tips will help you here.)\n3. Seeds, shoots, or cuttings. (Depending on the kinds of plants you want in your garden, you\'ll need to plant seeds, shoots, or cuttings. You can buy them from the local plant nursery, flower shop, or, again, your experienced next-door-neighbour. The gardening tips you can ask for from any of these places are free.) \n4. A small ploughing tool.\n5. Water\n\nOnce you have everything, the next step is to set up your garden:\n\n1. First, clear up any stuff your terrace or balcony already has. Your plants will need this space now.\n2. Fill your plant containers/pots with soil. Don\'t pack it in. Fill it loosely.\nSettle your seeds, shoots, or cuttings into the different containers of soil. (Seeds should be buried, of course.)\n3. Arrange your plant-containers on your terrace.\n4. Water them generously (though, not too generously). And then continue to water them every alternate day. (Do watch out during the hot summers though. If your plants and the soil looks dry, water them more.)\n5. Once every two to three weeks, use your small ploughing tool (it can even be a plastic knife or fork) to turn the soil and loosen it. (Remember, plants don\'t grow well in packed soil.)\n6.

This guy meticulously plans everything. Especially travel plans, as we travel a lot within the country. I just love the way he packs our stuff for the the trip. First and foremost have your tickets, hotel confirmation message, id proof handy and make sure it is in a safe bag, so that it isn\'t misplaced or lost. From what I have observed the following things are very essential during any trip;\n\n1. Clothes\n\nBefore we pack our clothes, we check the weather prediction of the place we are going to visit. Because if its going to rain in the place, what is the use of carrying summer clothes. So check for the weather report of the location during the particular time of visit and pack your clothese accordingly. \n\n2. Hygiene Essentials\n\nI always have a travel pouch ready with essential toiletries for both of us and I don\'t unpack it after trip. It would always be in my travel bag.\n\n3. Skin care\n\nYou are going to a humid seashore or a snowy mountain, it is essential that you are prepared to the face the weather. Sunscreens, Moisturizers  and cold creams are inevitable. Sometimes, it is important to protect our skin by covering it. So don\'t forget to carry an umbrella, scarf, rain coat, hat, etc. Again this would also be based on the weather condition predictions. \n\n4. Medical Kit\n\nI just don\'t compromise on this, even it is going to be a one day trip. I first check my first aid kit in car is well equipped with the gauge, antiseptic and bandage. It is very important to take extra care in case your are taking a baby, toddler or an elderly person along. Being a very careless walker, I somehow end up getting a bruise or a scratch during the trip.\nIf you take any regular medication, take it and always have a medical box ready with basic medication for a fever, cold, allergy, etc. \n\nI guess the above would do for a safe trip. I personally carry a flashlight and have always found it helpful. ', '1499849568'),

But, if you are most attracted to the region in South Bangalore, one is required to do some detailed research about the property. \nAs a first time buyer, the expert advice you can get here is to zero down your favorite region (in this case south Bangalore) look around the property surroundings for signs of industrialization, accommodations, and residents, public, private areas and the connectivity to other parts of â€˜Garden Cityâ€™ via South Bangalore. \nHereâ€™s a checklist as to how can you buy best located and suited property in south Bangalore:\n1.	Infrastructure/Groundwork  \n\n      Buying a property in South Bangalore is not an easy task, as it takes a lot of planning and thinking before signing on the dotted lines. Here infrastructure of the property means how the basic amenities do in and around the property look. If the ground is damaged there might be a water leakage issue once the property is developed.  Examine the soil arrangement, and know its form. Loose soil is not recommended for construction.\n\n2.	Examining the Paperwork\nIt is one of the most important things that you as a buyer should remember. Paperwork stands crucial, as recently many property buyers were duped with false paperwork in Bangalore, especially in the South region. Entities like BBMP certificate, Encumbrance certificate, and other documents should be analyzed in order to complete a legalized buying. \n\n3.	Inquire about Resale Value\n\nYes, you heard that right. Even before buying the property get an idea about the resale value that can catalyze the investment. The property that has an additional resale value may help you in reaping bigger benefits in case, after some time you think of selling it. Do remember that investment in an asset comes with long term benefits and plans for your future.    \n\n', '1500026602'),

(4522, 281, 2, 25, 0, 'Why hiring an editor is important for ESL candidates\n\nContent is ubiquitousâ€”one cannot imagine life without it. However, it is not enough to simply have content. It must speak to the reader. It must be organized as well as attractive. Most importantly, it must adhere to the rules of grammar and punctuation. Bad content is akin to no content. It serves no purpose and may even repel the reader. Thus, the skills of an editor find great use everywhere.\nThe job of an editor is manifold. He or she checks for errors in grammar and punctuation and ensures clarity of thought. In addition, editors also correct improper word choice and awkward-sounding sentences. This process is known as line editing. If there is a need for in-depth editing, an editor may also check facts and citations. This is called substantive editing. \nBut why is it significant for ESL candidates to hire an editor for their documents?\nâ€¢	English is their second language. By definition, ESL candidates use English as their second language. Most probably, they are not as well-versed in English as compared to native English speakers. It may be difficult for ESL candidates to appropriately translate their thoughts into English. \nâ€¢	Not just grammar and punctuation. ESL candidates do not need assistance with just correcting grammatical errors, they may miss things like proper word choice and sentence structure because of their different linguistic background.\nâ€¢	Inability to proofread. Even if you are a native English speaker, you cannot always proofread your own work to produce an error-free document. This is especially true if you have just finished drafting the document. You need a second pair of eyes to catch the finer mistakes. For ESL candidates, even if they are able to find the mistakes, they may not know how to fix them. This is where a capable editor comes in handy.\nâ€¢	Unfamiliarity with formatting and citation rules. Many journals reject papers because their formatting rules have not been followed or have been incorrectly implemented. An experienced editor can be crucial for your paper to be accepted for publishing. \nESL candidates may be experts in their field and also have a fair grasp on the English language, but they will still need an editor to help them transform their satisfactory documents to brilliant ones. \n\n \n', '1500051897'),

Start ups need a solid strategy to become profitable and the sad fact is most of the start ups that come to the market see a negative atmosphere in terms of political and social support in India.\n\nHowever, the situations are changing now. Governments are coming up with new support initiatives to make the start ups a success. The youth of India is really upbeat about that. The new campaigns and policies offered by the central and state governments are helping Indian youth have confidence and financial support to start their own start ups. This is a very important step in making India a economic superpower.\nThe youth wants the start ups to be successful and they work hard for it. They do all research and planning and believe that the government would back them up with financial and networking help. For the youth of India, start ups are the natural expression of their belief in being self reliant. They think that by building an own ecosystem of new businesses, they can reap the benefits of financial freedom.\n\nThe path to success in making start ups shine is tough and very competitive. While the IT and communication technologies have made starting a new business easier, it has also reduced the cost to entry and increased the competition in the market. The youth of India knows that there are many problems in making start ups successful, and they are ready to face the challenges.

However exotic these places undoubtedly are, the variety and diversity of this beautiful state deserves greater mention. So here you go, here are 8 rather offbeat places to explore in Himachal\n\n- Kheerganga - Kheerganga is a special kind of exotic, even while measured up against the rest of Himachal. Located 40-50 km away from mainstream Himachali tourist spots, the place is straight out of the sets of Game of thrones, with snow capped peaks interspersed with bright green meadows resembling the Scottish countryside. There are hardly a couple of shops dotted against the landscape, making it an ideal â€˜Get away from civilisationâ€™ spot for the inner melodramatist in you.\n\n- Magic Valley - I was badly tempted to include Malana in the list, but thatâ€™s been done to death so much that Iâ€™m plumping for Magic Valley instead. Far flung in the upper reaches of the Himalayas beyond Malana, this is where Indian hash and hemp are officially grown, nurtured and exported to places like Amsterdam, where theyâ€™re recognised as the most expensive Hashish in the whole world. Thatâ€™s mind boggling\n\n- The twin villages of Kalga and Tulga - Kalga and Tulga are a couple of remote villages some way off Bershaini. A lack of transportation beyond the latter means one has to walk a good 10km to reach Kalga, but boy is it worth it. A laid back, sleepy village greets you, where time stops still and a healthy mix of Indians and Israelis discuss life and philosophy all day, while sipping on freshly brewed Himachali ale. Bliss! Tulga is pretty much the same, albeit with the occasional rave party.\n\n- The gurudwara at Manikaran - This may seem like a monotonous religious suggestion at first glance, but its anything but. The gurudwara at Manikaran is a metaphorical representationof the whole of Himachal in its diversity, with people from all corners of the country, and even beyond, thronging its halls throughout the day. The gurudwara offers free lodging and dining irrespective of caste, nationality and other superficial criteria, adding to its charm and appeal.\n\n- The hot spring at Kasol - Kasol is generally perceived as the party place of the Himalayas, a mini Goa of sorts. However, as tiny as the place is, there are still peaceful things to do if you look carefully enough. And, one of these peaceful locations is the hot spring, and accompanying hot caves, some way off the main town. Imagine lying in a hot spring all night while the weather outside touches freezing temperature. Enough said!\n\n- Jari - The very definition of a town that has stood still while modernisation has completely passed it by, but in a pleasant way. Hardly a stoneâ€™s throw from busy bustling Kasol, Jari could hardly be different in looks or nature. Prices are nearly half that in Kasol, while the people are twice as friendlier. Maybe not having to deal with inquisitive tourists seven times a day helps!\n\n- The babas of Himachal  - Alright, this is not just a list of places, and it would be criminal of me not to mention the fascinating Babas the state has to offer. Youâ€™re likely to run into approximately 4-5 babas a day if youâ€™re trekking through the state, all in various forms of intoxication. However, the yarns they can spin to keep you occupied are quite frankly brilliant, and theyâ€™re some of the nicest, most down to earth people you can hope to meet. To top it off, each baba comes with his own, authentic â€˜How I left home at 14â€™ story that belongs in a hollywood flick.', '1501155386'),

Is it the things you keep inside it such as furniture, pots and plants, lights and fixtures? Not really!! Because, even a hotel room has four walls and beautiful decor; but you wouldnâ€™t call that a home right?\nObviously, you would like your home to have a nice-looking sofa and dining set for entertaining guests, a beautiful state of the art kitchen where you cook delicious meals for your family and friends, comfortable beds, spacious closets and so on. But, there are many other things that really give you a warm fuzzy feeling of being in your home.\nPhotos and memories\nHaving big and small framed pictures of you and your family all around the house adds that feeling of being home. Also, many people like to have a â€œwall of fameâ€ that contains collectibles from places they have visited; it could be a shot glass from Las Vegas or wooden miniature furniture from a local handicraft exhibition, or even a rug that has been passed on from generations.\nSounds and smells\nEach home has a unique smell to it. The smell could be of the food being prepared in the kitchen, the smell of incense sticks, and other house smells. When you come home after a long vacation it is this smell that makes you really feel at home. \nSometimes it is the sounds that are unique to each home. The barking of the dog, the din in the kitchen as someone is washing the dishes, the whirring of the washing machine, the gentle tinkling of the prayer bell, and so on.\nA little mess here and there\nA sparkly, shiny looking house according to me looks way too artificial. A home on the other hand is a bit messy; a place where you find dirty dishes in the sink, little crumbs of food where the baby sat to eat, pet hair on the sofa, and a not-so-dry bathroom! \nA house is just a place of shelter, but a home is what you make out of it to call your own!\n\n\n', '1502672472'),

While youâ€™ve taken the time to shop for clothes and the right amount of food, weâ€™d like you to consider buying the right bag for your journey.\nWeâ€™re sure youâ€™re confused and not sure where to start or how to go about the purchase. Hereâ€™s why weâ€™ve drafted a few tips:\n1.	Length: The kind of bag you purchase would depend on the length of the voyage. If itâ€™s for the weekend alone, consider a light carry-on. However for longer trips, weâ€™d advice a rolling luggage.\n2.	Transportation: If youâ€™re expecting way too many layovers or pit-stops, weâ€™d recommend a wheeled backpack or a lightweight bag.\n3.	On the go: If youâ€™re spontaneous and on the go, you could consider a travel pack. These packs make available several travel features most backpacks donâ€™t come with. \nNow that youâ€™ve got a vague idea, make sure to check with the warranty of the luggage bag as well. You may also want to check with the airline for the size restrictions. While some donâ€™t bother, you could get yourself in trouble for an extremely big bag. Either way, weâ€™d also recommend that you check the zips, quality of the material and handles of the bag thoroughly before making a purchase. \nInstead of opting for a bright red or yellow, consider a black. This way you could use the bag for travel as well as business.  All youâ€™ll probably need would be a tag with your name on it. This should help identify the bag for you. \nIn all, look for a bag that would fit your budget and comfort. Avoid something fancy; it may not help in the long run. \n', '1504618094'),

While on the one hand, start-ups have revolutionized work culture - infusing into it refreshing new attitudes and questioning the strict boundaries the traditional workforce imposed - but it isn\'t without its flaws. Sure, there are start-ups that have struck gold; whether it be social media outlets, or online delivery services, or online cab companies; but there are also start-ups that have, in trying to modernize the nature of work, made some terrible omissions. Take \'The Viral Fever\' for example, a youtube-based content creation start-up that has gained remarkable popularity since it\'s inception in 2013. Only a few months ago, the company became mired in conspiracy when it\'s founder was accused of sexual harassment. Instead of dealing with the allegations with the seriousness and maturity established corporate companies should, they attempted to discredit the accuser entirely in their initial response. This ended up being a major oversight on their part, leading to a large-scale online fallout and a resultant FIR. \nThe unprecedented rise of start-ups in India have not just been because of economic reasons. While a dip in employment rates did create the necessity for newer avenues of work - mostly digital - being created, the need for start-ups also became an inherently social one. The middle class youth, having had more educational and financial access than their parents before them, were itching to step out of the conventional frameworks created for them. They were itching to challenge the status quo, merely because the status quo was so unfair to them - stifling creativity instead of fostering it. It\'s not a surprise that most start-up founders emerge from premier educational institutes (or corporate organisations), where they have been utterly exhausted of constantly doing something that they aren\'t finding satisfaction in.\nBut despite it all, while start-ups are in fact an important part of our current economy and cultural capital, there needs to be maturity exercised by the same. Unlike The Viral Fever, start-ups also need to take responsibility for the actions of their employees and founders, should ensure the existence of an effective human resources system, should establish sexual harrassment committees and take other necessary steps to make sure the rights of the employees are preserved.

Right after conceiving the child, every woman undergoes a gradual realization deep within on how imperative it becomes during the time, more than ever, to protect oneself from all sorts of diseases or health disorders for the fear of them passing on to the little soul about to come into this world. And for giving the very best of everything to your child even before they have come into the world, it is crucial to have access to adequate information, particularly during the last month. As the last month arrives and the countdown sets rolling for the delivery period, a woman ought to have an entirely different feeling about her body, having undergone several changes and thus, needs to be all the more cautious in handling things the right way. Now, aside form the obvious ones, let\'s have a quick look at a few vital do\'s and don\'t that anyone rarely tells us to keep in mind during the last month of that crucial phase.\n\nDo\'s\n\n1.  Try and sleep on your left as it is considered to the best for the baby\'s breathing, comfort and overall well-being.\n2.   Eat just right- avoid all junk at this stage in particular and eat a nutritious filling diet to prepare for the tough delivery period of 40 days, just around the corner.\n3. Try to keep your feet elevated as much as possible to avoid swelling yet do mild walking to stay active but nothing hard.\n4. Try to stay calm and positive, it goes a long way in reducing the last minute anxieties and thus, chances are that it will make the delivery easier for you.\n5. Follow proper hygiene and try to keep your vaginal area as dry as possible to avoid the fungal infection, else consult the doctor immediately in case of any symptoms like itching etc.\n\nDon\'ts\n\n1. Never sleep with your stomach down as it can have severe adverse affects on the baby, even cutting out the breathing completely at times.\n2. Do not over exert yourself in the wake of a normal delivery because contrary to the norm that exercise and physical work increases your chances of a normal delivery, it may also result into some accident or injury owing to the heaviness and rather imbalanced self-state that you are in.\n3. Do not turn suddenly or bend down completely putting any unnecessary weight or causing inconvenience to the baby inside. Try to be slow and gently in movements.\n4. Be careful while having intercourse as this phase is the most crucial one for the delivery can take place almost any time once the ninth month begins. Be gentle and vocal about any discomfort you feel during the process.\n5. More than ever, be extra cautious while taking any non-prescribed medicines; do consider its effect on the baby and consult your doctor before taking any such thing at all.', '1505993282'),

It may have a shape, size or unique design but it\'s just a shell without life. When we enter a building we notice the architectural finesse, but it doesn\'t portray any characteristic. As soon as a person or family occupies the house, they bring with them their own personality.\nAs we visit someone\'s home, we notice the furniture, the wall decor, the books that adorn the shelves and immediately we get an impression of the residents.\nA house can be transformed into a home mainly by the people residing in it. We can start by arranging the furniture in our own way to create a space suitable for us to live and work. Then we add the curtains or blinds, which bring colour and warmth to the settings. Gradually we set up the kitchen so that it would be functional as well as neat and clean. The aroma of food gives a distinct feeling of home. In this way we decorate the different rooms and utility areas to our satisfaction and comfort.\nAs we add family pictures or paintings, the house become a home. They add to the sense of being a part of a family and creates a cheerful atmosphere. The art and artefacts we collect throughout our lives, reminds us of the joyful past, the memories we would like to treasure. Now comes the books, which I mentioned before, that reveals our interests as well as our preferences. Sometimes childhood books of grown up children may be preserved and evoke fond memories.\nLast but not the least, it is the presence of the occupants, the sound of their laughter, their family time and even their bickering transforms a bare structure into a home, where we would love to return at the end of each day or a holiday tour. Sometimes a perfectly neat and clean house, like a hotel room lack the personal touch that an open book or an empty soup bowl on a table might provide.\nThank You', '1506063358'),

(5329, 323, 5, 55, 0, '\nThe idea of dressing your age is not about changing your personal style as the years go by, but rather adapting your wardrobe to reflect your style in an age-appropriate fashion.To dress for your age is to know how to put together an outfit that wouldn\'t cause you to look a decade older than you actually are, or make people assume you might have borrowed your daughter\'s dress. If you were a rock chick in your 20s, you can still be one in your 50s. You might just have to put away certain tanks and tees you used to love in your youth, and opt for rocker clothing with more mature appeal. The clock will keep turning. Fashion trends always come and go. At certain times in life, you do have to make some adaptations, but that doesn\'t mean you have to completely change who you are.\n\nDressing Your Age - 20s\n\nAnything under the sun is possible. Don\'t be afraid to experiment. Fashion is not like drugs. It might make you look foolish at times but it won\'t ruin your life. Even if you actually commit a fashion disaster, it doesn\'t matter; you\'re young!\nBuy clothing and accessories that can be easily mixed and matched with one another. Allow yourself plenty of room for creativity and adaptation. A short pleated skirt, for example, can make you look all sweet and preppy once paired with a striped cashmere sweater. When the same skirt is complemented by sassy leggings and a washed-out rocker tee, however, that\'s a totally different look.\nYour clothes should have lots of personality. This doesn\'t mean you have to wear bright colors or glitzy accessories, though. If your style is feminine and classy, then embrace it but don\'t be boring. Don\'t be afraid to look ultra-feminine with ruffles, polka dots or a retro skirt. No matter what your style is, just keep it interesting and playful. Save serious-looking outfits for your later years.\n', '1510123028'),

Curtains Your house can never look beautiful unless those drapes falling from the very above steal the heart of a person who looks at them. The best idea acoording to me is to start from the highest possible point to fix your curtains. Long drapes give it a royal feel. For the arches and small pasaages the ones with beads and pearls will do wonders.\n2 Lightning I am personally a dim light lover but hey! You need to check whether each place in your house is well lighted as per the work that\'s required to be done there.\nI would prefer my study to be well lit with some amount of blue in it as it is said to render sleep and who doesnt feel sleepy in a study? For the bedroom i would prefer dim lights in the ceiling that could be LED; they would give you the best romatic experience with your significant other. Corridors and guest rooms badly need those big chandeliers to welcome any party with beautiful people.\n3 A Dark Room Seeking respite from the scroching heat in Delhi who doesnt want to rush to cooler and much soothing places and how lucky would you be if you had a dark room by your  next door. Its supposed to be as much raw as it can as for I have done it with a few broken pieces of wood, straw, stones, pebbles and a couple or two of those antique lanterns and even furniture would make anyone go gaga over the sight. \nA hookah and a mini bar at such place would again be a bonus\n\nThats my idea of a dream home.

Don\'t forget holy flowers or the flowers of God and Goddess. After all, you are going to be a God for your own garden,\n3. Arrange your garden in a fashion that you can get a proper space to walk, to meditate and to sit. Remember, it is necessary to give an open look to your garden. \n4. Put some cradle and rides in your garden if it is a terrace or an open one. For balcony lovers, chairs will be the best solution.\n5. Include small open beakers and place them at the positions which seems possible to you. The water in the beaker will keep birds busy in your garden and will give heavens look to your garden.\n6.

Being a PhD myself, I can assure you that this experience changes not only the way one percieives life, it also revolutionises the way we experience everyday life. In a country like India, with immense youth power, the idea of a research culture is mostly non-existent. The experience of engaging in a serious, self-explorative degree like Phd is considered more of a race against time and rules, just in a bid to touch the finishing line without having to undergo the rigmarole of it.The entire education system is to be blamed for this gaping loophole in research culture which ends up creating degree flaunting shallow preachers of knowledge rather than profound and compassionate teachers of experience. Another pertinent aspect of working on a PhD in India is the style of writing promoted by mentors and supervisors, which is termed as \'academic style\' for all intents and purposes, without realising that this results in completely destroying the individuality, creativity and eventually the personality of the research scholar. Research begets openness of expression and the freedom to enjoy the process, which is indiscriminately denied by emphasis on toeing the line of academic writing. Every scholar brings with him/her, a unique intellectual prowess and hunger to explore and hence should be constructively and delicately handled by the mentors,which can  actively help in creating a strong, free thinking class of teachers.\n\nI am not in a position to compare the styles of doing PhD elsewhere in the world since I have no clue about how things work out apart from India. There could possibly be better or worse ways of going about research in other countries, but if the fundamental aspects of engaging in research are compromised, there can be no genuine PhDs.\n', '1511431249'),

As the adage goes: Home is where the heart is, the idea behind a home is not just about brick and mortar. A quality home depends a lot on how well the occupants maintain it. One of the primary ingredients is to maintain order. Now, this transcends to everything that exists within the four walls of the house. The use and disposing of things should reflect this order. It also expected to be seen in the relations. When people live in peace, they naturally reflect the order.

If you are reading this, you may already be knowing what it is or at least have heard about it from your faculty, seniors or peers.\nIt is a summary of everything youâ€™ve learned from your specific course and a representation of this summary as a written project.

While thesis is usually subject specific and marks the end of a semester, a dissertation is more detailed and summarizes the learning outcomes of your entire course.\n\n2.Meet your guide sparingly through the project:\nThough your dissertation is an individual task and should be done to the best of your own abilities, your guides are there for a purpose. They will give you invaluable tips and make sure you are on right track throughout your project. Avoiding from them is surely not going to help your cause.\n\n3.Slack through your submissions:\nIf your plan is to keep delaying the research and the writing till the last hour, you have already ensured poor results. The time allotted to you is probably already less than required or just the right amount and losing any of it will only take away from the quality of your work. \n\n4.Choose wrong team or depend on it too much:\nItâ€™s not going to work out if you think north is the right way when your team is already heading south.

Global warming has become one of the greatest issues in the current scenario and greenery is becoming a thing of the past. This article shall help you set up an organic terrace garden which can offer a great solution for your mental and physical well being. You may choose to grow veggies, herbs, flowers or just an exotic green landscape that shall add to the aesthetics of your home.\nBelow are some pointers to remember for setting up a terrace garden.\n1. Preparing the rooftop\nThe first step is to prepare pots that may be wooden, ceramic or anything else but plastic. You must choose large and deep pots that provide adequate drainage for growing healthy plants and vegetables. Moreover, the layout of your garden must be prepared at a convenience for the plants. The weak plants must be placed in the shady parts of the terrace while the stronger ones in the sunnier area.\n2. Preparing the potting mix\nThe potting mix must be prepared from a mixture of red soil, cow dung, Neem oil, river sand, coconut fibre and vermicompost.\n3. Planting the seeds\nAfter the soil is ready, the seeds must be planted and sprinkled with water. After the shoots rise up to 3 or 4 inches, they can be transplanted into pots.\n4. Arrange for pesticides and insecticides\nNo matter what kind of protection is used, pests and insects would be visiting the garden. You can prepare a mixture of cooking oil, baking soda and water to spray on plants that would keep the plants from fungal infection.\n5. Install wind barriers\nIf your terrace is located at a higher altitude in comparison to your neighbourhood, your terrace garden might face heavy winds that can destroy tender stems and plants. Garden shades can help protect your rooftop garden plants.\nEvery plant requires different amount of heat, light and water. Proper directions must be followed for maintaining your organic rooftop garden.\n\n', '1515753890'),

New enterprises led by young professionals are mushrooming across sectors. Gone are the days when the youth would queue up for jobs, now they are creating jobs.  We have come a long way and evolved into a nation of entrepreneurs. \nThe youth today do not believe in working for someoneâ€™s dream, they want to fulfil their own. And with generous aids from the government of the day, the landscape seems more and more promising for the new India. While enough research has been done to understand how to best tame the new beast called start-ups, only more experience and study cases can help make the picture clearer. \nThis trend does not necessarily indicate that the importance of education and degrees has declined. On the contrary, studies have showed that the youth are still flocking to elite institutes such as IITs and IIMs. However, what they do with the education has changed with the arrival of start-ups. While till a few decades ago, graduates from these institutions would eye the cushiest jobs out there, now they look to start their own company. \nIt would be wrong to assume that only those armed with an IIM or an IIT degree can make a start-up successful. Young adults of all age and background are joining the bandwagon in large numbers and creating some very interesting businesses. And with the booming start-up scene, the large conglomerates are facing tough competition, while the end customer is benefitting from the plethora of options they are being offered.\nMoreover, the attitude of the old players have seen a paradigm shift lately. Instead of looking at start-ups as disruptions, several large businesses are treating them as allies for a better future. They are not only looking to fund these new ventures, but also collaborate with them to benefit from their ecosystem. This provides tangible encouragement to the start-up brigade and also a foreseeable future of coexistence. \nSo, with the encouragement from the government, allies in big corporates, and the right attitude, the youthâ€™s looking at a brighter future through start-ups, the long-awaited push for the countryâ€™s economy, and a spot for India in the international forum as a start-up destination.   \n', '1515753916'),

Modi believed that, with the innovative ideas that the young mind comes up with, it will be a great boost to the economy of the country both directly and indirectly and help to address many other problems associated with it. The government also decided to fund some startups as much as possible to attract more youngsters into the world of startups.\n\nThis was introduced to motivate more people from the younger generation to become entrepreneurs and industrialists which would result in more employment opportunities created for the Indians, thereby reducing the major problem of unemployment in India.\n\nThis initiative has been driven by major IITs, NITs and majority of the government institutions in motivating the students to develop the mindset of becoming entrepreneurs. After the introduction of this initiative, there was a vast improvement in the introduction of startups, even at the level of universities.\n\nVarious universities enabled their students to have their offices on campus and operate from there.

First only is the  clean water spots in the sink, for that you can put some vinegar in the sink, let it rest for some time and then wipe  it with cloth.  Second, would be removing stain from steel tap, put some ketchup on the tap, let it rest for 10-15  minute, then gently  rub it with cloth and clean it with water. Third, is storing half cut vegetables like tomato, lemon and especially onion. If you keep onion, opened in the refrigerator whole fridge will start stinking, to avoid this always keep them in airtight containers. Ideally we should also avoid using half cut onion as it turned poisonous after some time.  \nFry making fried chicken, after coating it with egg and bread crumbs keep it in the fridge for at least 15-20 minutes, by ding this covering will not get stick to the frying pan and the chicken will cook very crispy.  \nTo  avoid snacks, getting moist in the rainy season you should keep them in freezer. Freezer!! I know it sounds a bit weird, but this ids tried and tested and it actually works. A quick and easy tip to clean the microwave is to put some vinegar in a bowl and put in inside it. Run the microwave for 1 minute, and gently wipe it with clean cloth. I know I have to write 20 hacks, but as I said in starting only I don\'t know much about and also do not have time to research and then write so ending my blog here only. Hope these little hacks help you. Happy cooking!!', '1515835208'),

According to Startup India, the country has the second largest ecosystem in the world in terms of its size, reach, and impact. Most of these startups are tech startups, implying a plethora of opportunities for the 1.5 million engineers that the country churns out every year. Several Indians consider starting their own business as a valid and serious career option, which is splendid as their innovation, growth, and employability will help our country fuel its economy and lower unemployment rates. Also, with their flamboyant, youthful, and flexible organizational structure, startups also serve as an attractive employment option. With their flexible work hours, young, dress-code free and fun work environments, and possibilities of remote work, many startups are redefining the way Indians work.\nHowever, there\'s an ugly side to Indian startups. With entrepreneurship, there\'s an obvious risk of failure. The western world looks at failures as lessons. It\'s different in a country like India where failure is frowned upon at any point in time. This creates an immense pressure on startups to succeed at any costs. This ends up creating a work culture of unrealistic expectations, toxic work environment, job insecurity, excruciatingly long working hours, lack of growth, and changing priorities and goals. Many startup founders lack work and managerial experience and end up creating unfriendly and hostile work environments, making everyone miserable. \nIn spite of all the ugly truths to startups in India, 2018 is a great time to be an Indian entrepreneur. There is no dearth to the opportunities, resources, and human capital available in this day and age. The increasing access to the internet, and therefore to information and networks, also works in favour of a young Indian entrepreneur. However, they shouldn\'t ignore the importance of work-life balance and healthy work environments for their employees. After all, the most important capital for any business is human capital. While focusing on the business model, objectives and goals are important, taking care of your employees, cherishing them and valuing their achievements, and giving them opportunities to grow is of paramount importance.

Your next task is to ensure that your terrace is strong enough to bear the additional weight of plants. It should also have adequate water proofing and insulation to avoid any possibility of leakages in future. You would be required to water your plants daily, so make sure that the soil you use  is porous and has a good drainage capacity. If these qualities are not present in the soil, absorption of nutrients and availability of air would be lacking for plants, thereby restricng their growth. In case, there is high wind speed at your terrace, install treils to regulate it so that your plants remain protected.\nNow begins the most important preparation which is planning out the position of plants on your terrace. Plan in such a way that you make the most of use of the space available. Coordinating the colours of flowers would also enhance the scenic beauty of your terrace. Pot containers and the soil used should be selected keeping in mind the space and nutrients each plant would require to grow. Treils would be a big support to climbers. Do not forget to assemble the equipments required for watering, planting and decorating your terrace garden.\nYou are now ready to build a place for you and your family to relax and rejuvenate as well as an environment which would provide you with purest form of air.

Most items you require to get started with your terrace garden are accessible in local nurseries at good prices. If youâ€™re too distant away from a nursery, then, there are plenty of online stores to buy plants, seeds and other gardening equipment from.\n\nBut, before you get begun with the essentials, there is one important factor that plays a key role in terrace gardening, itâ€™s your mindset. Here are some points to remember when you start your terrace garden project:\n\n \n\n1.      Be Ready To Get Dirty:\n\nThe funny part about gardening is that you can muck around in the water, manure, and mud. It\'s therapeutic as well, so be prepared to get your hands dirty or murky.\n\n \n\n2.      Be Ready To Deal with Pests and Insects:\n\nOur environment is home to many bugs, insects and other pests. If you create a terrace garden, be ready to meet, greet and beat all kinds of welcome and unwelcome visitors sometimes even a monkey or lizards too.\n\n \n\n3.      Set A Minimum of an Hour from Your Routine:\n\nBe ready to spend at least one hour in your day to look after your terrace garden. Once the setup is organized, you will spend less time looking after it and more time enjoying the benefits. Letâ€™s say half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the evening should be fine if you canâ€™t spend an entire hour at a stretch.\n\n \n\n4.      Do Research:\n\nThe web or internet is full of new ideas, hacks and tricks to nurture your garden. Take out some time to do research to get some good ideas.\n\n \n\n5.      Prepare a Plan of Action:\n\nItâ€™s quite common to get excited and grow too many things at a go. Restrain yourself. You have a lot of time. Prepare a list of the plants you want to have and how to arrange them in your terrace. Taking action becomes easier if you have drawn up a proper plan.\n\n ', '1542722871'),

Also, you can go for a good mix of indoor and outdoor plants to give your garden an interesting ecosystem.\nDo your bit of research on the kind of soil each of your selected plants need. This way you can ensure your plants grow healthy and keep you healthy as well.\nSource your seeds and fertiliser from a trusted source. \nBuy all the necessary equipment you need for your gardenâ€“ right from setting it up, to growing your seeds, watering them when you are there and you are away, and taming your garden at regular intervals.\nDo not forget your pesticides!\n\nI hope these quick tips on setting up your terrace garden are helpful!\n', '1542723514'),

The quality of research not only depends on the PhD student but also on the supervisors. Most supervisors are busy in teaching which is what the focus of universities is nowadays. Research is not a priority. Doing a PhD from Indian universities is a frustrating experience. It takes ages to complete the thesis as there are several obstacles in your path. Scholarships often get delayed by years and students have to make do with whatever they have. Some of them have to borrow money from their friends and family. Supervisors are often not open to new ideas and hence PhDs produced are often the repetition of the past work or the work that has already been conducted in the western world. Supervisors often treat their scholars as surf. They ask them to household chores or clean their office desk and such tasks. This often causes various mental health issues among the students. Mental health among PhDs is an issue which is often swept under the rug. No one cares what PhD students go through unlike western universities where you have dedicated personnel to take care of you. There are many other issues that cripple the development of researcher in Indian institutions. In order to get through the PhD, you have to have good relations with your supervisor. Your good relations with your supervisor is the only thing that can get you an academic position in an Indian university. If you donâ€™t have good terms with your supervisors, you should forget about academia and look for jobs in the industry where things are fairer.   ', '1542724018'),

A great deal of experience it is - nausea, mood swings, pains, aches, hunger pangs and then the first kick, the rolling baby movements - somethings you will recollect and relive many times even years later. This last month may not be the same as the last ones but has it\'s own share of goods and not-so-good experiences. \nExpect this month to be more stable in the first couple of weeks but will show a completely different face in the last two weeks. As you yearn and wait to hold your baby in hands, there are a few things you need to take care in this final stage of the journey.\nThough your doctor and elders around are a good support, here are a few tips from some more experienced souls;\nDo\'s:\na. It is important to take good rest and eat well during the last few weeks. Ensure that the food intake is healthy and does not cause acidity, gas and discomfort. Also, try to sleep well despite the problems related to your changed structure and heaviness. Remember that sleep will get disturbed for a while after the baby arrives.\nb. Exercise: Regular, mild exercises are recommended during this stage of pregnancy. Take your walks, try some water exercises whenever possible -they are mild for body and help to ease the labor process. \nc. Watch out for the signs of labor - a sharp pain in lower abdomen, discharge that begins and continues.\nd. Talk to your elders and doctor about any doubt. Remain positive, read books, listen to music and relax.\nf. Maintain hygiene. \ng. Prepare your elder child, if you have one, for the new arrival. Also, prepare yourself with things that would be required by you and your baby while in the hospital. \nh. Take care of your posture while you sleep and sit. Try warm baths for the aches and pains.\n\nDont\'s: While you take care of things for yourself and the new baby, do take a note of being cautious about some things;\na. Don\'t take any kind of mental and physical stress. Exercise is good but it should be mild and not rigorous. \nb. Be careful about what you eat. Continue avoiding things that your doctors and elders have advised. No alcohol, no smoking and not even very spicy food. \nc. Avoid sudden change in position while sitting and standing. Although sex is not prohibited, rather, it is said to aid in smooth labor, it has to be practiced with caution and without pressing on the womb. \nd. Don\'t ignore any sign that makes you feel anxious. A discharge and sharp pain may be sign of labor but make sure to wait till it becomes significant. \n\nFinally, it is always good to take guidance from your elders and the doctor and not ignore your intuitions. Take care and happy motherhood...', '1542725213'),

I shall elucidate on a few pointers that will help in this area. \n\nFirstly we dwell on the bare essentials. The house needs to cleaned and dusted. Please choose a nice palette of colours to complement your home. Soothing light colours reflect light and will give you an illusion of brightness and larger space. For kids/ teenagers you may want to opt for bold colours to highlight their territorial spaces which they would love. \n\nSecond, coming to the interiors and your furniture - please do not overboard and clutter your entire home. Having good space to move around feels good not only for you but for kids as well to play around. Your furniture and cupboards are upto your liking. You can frame happy family photos in your living room. Also, if your into collecting antique items - picking such antique pieces of your choice and placing in your hall/ rooms would add a touch of your personal signature. Having indoor plants that emit oxygen/ purify air is also a very good step in having a refreshing light environment. It will also get kids interested in plants and gardening. If you like crafts, glass painting - you can always hand your paintings, keep your wine bottles for glass painting. Toys make an area to keep your children\'s toys. \n\nApart from all these - a good home is always built on good memories. So don\'t forget to smile and be happy!', '1542728241'),

The weather of the place youâ€™re traveling to\nWhen it comes to cold place, you have clothes of thicker materials, and you hence need a bigger bag.

Firstly, a travel bag should have enough space to accommodate atleast a weeks clothes and accessories.Also, the knick-knacks we need for our daily use. It must have a small and easy accessible documents compartment. And, if one likes reading the space should be large enough to accommodate one or two quick reading books.Needless to say, it must have enough space for water bottles and sleeping bags. And the most important thing to consider when travelling is the shoes. So, a travelling bag must have separate compartments for shoes. \nGenerally, when we invest on a bag we try to get most out of it. As we cannot keep buying a new bag every time we plan a trip. Mostly its a one-time-long-term investment. Hence, the material should be sturdy enough to last long through the years. Being a traveller myself I know we rarely want to invest anytime thinking about making space for the stuffs we buy at our destination to bring along some memories of the very interesting place we visited. Therefore we ought to have some extra space for the souvenirs we pickup en-route.\nAnd, the bad should be comfortable to carry around like it should have thick cushioned staps etc.\n', '1542730991'),

In this context, it is worth mentioning that, in most of the countries, getting a PhD or rather earning a PhD is considered as a basic requirement to stay in academia. In other words, if you wish to be a scientist or a professor, you must have a PhD degree. However, the situation largely is different in India where you can become a teacher in college even without a PhD degree. Moreover, you can even hold a scientist position in some places without obtaining the highest university degree, i.e., PhD. However, if you really want to contribute to the society both scientifically and meaningfully, obtaining a PhD is a mandate. It is not just a mere degree but a platform to see the world of science under a microscope for first time in life. It not only enlightens you scientifically but also provides you the power of analyzing any complex situation and realizing its outcomes, as well as gives you the strength of overcoming the hurdles that come with all these complex situations. Another very important thing which every research scholar should understand is that you don\'t pursue a PhD just to get a particular type of job; rather, having a PhD actually opens a lot of gates for you toward your dream career. If you are successful of obtaining knowledge through your PhD, you can actually choose from a variety of scientific fields and contribute significantly to the society in general.    ', '1542777941'),

It not only brings in greenery to the surroundings but also act as a good hangout place if one adds in good sitting chairs and tables. With trees been recklessly felled for constructions, terrace garden is a good way of bringing in greenery. Setting up a terrace garden is easier. With gardening tools, seeds, plants easily available online or at the nearby nursery store, it takes hardly a day to set up a good terrace garden. The things needed for the set up includes a tarpaulin for the waterproof surface, soil, seeds, water supply, pesticides and garden shades. \n\nThe first step to setting up an efficient terrace garden is to install wind barriers and shields. Terraces bear the burnt of high speed winds, which break the shoots of plants and damage them. Thereby, one should make sure to install a durable and strong wind barrier to protect the terrace garden. The second step is to prepare the layout of the terrace garden. Before one places the plants, it is good to consider the light and heat factors. plants need for heat and light to grow. As such, taking into consideration the direction of the sun and how the plants would get their required supply of heat, the layout should be designed. Also, a regular water supply from a convenient source is essential for the plants to survive. \n\nThe main ingredient for the plant to grow is manure and nutrients, which makes the third step. Preparing the right proportion of nutrients and adding to the plants regularly is a task in itself. A plant without nutrients would wither away sooner than expected. Once the compost is ready, the seeds and saplings can be planted. It should be noted that the roots of the saplings not be exposed to direct sunlight as it would dry up the roots and kill them. Thereafter, the pots can be decorated and transported as per the layout on the terrace. The final step of setting up a terrace garden is to protect them from pests, birds and animals. Bugs, ants, birds would be regular visitors to the plants to  destroy them. As such, one should invest in pesticides and nylon wires to protect the plants from these visitors. \n\nSetting up a terrace garden is a lovely way of introducing greenery and nature to the home and the surroundings. One can also add few sitting chairs and a small table and enjoy their regular evening cuppa of tea or coffee in the beautiful terrace garden they built up!', '1542779913'),

How about getting the greenery indoors and setup your very own terrace garden in your home to give you a relaxed feeling whenever you get back home from a hard day\'s work leaving all the stress behind. Plants and greenery have the ability to refresh your mind, giving you the calm and peace you need. Here is a step-wise guide that will help you to setup your very own terrace garden. \n\n1. Waterproofing\n\nThis is one of the first things you need to take care of before setting up your garden. Check your terrace for any leaks and get it water proofed. You can invest in a tarpaulin sheet and get your ground covered with it if youâ€™re doing it yourself. You could also get in touch with some professionals to get this sorted out for you. \n\n2. Soil\n\nOf course, you cannot start gardening without soil, right? You need some good soil that is well nourished and conditioned in order to get healthy and strong plants. Do your research and find a place where you could buy some good soil for your plants. Most nurseries would have well-nourished soil. \n\n3. Plant Containers\n\nYes, you would need some pretty containers for your garden to look beautiful and inviting. Today, you can find loads of beautiful plant containers online. You could also decide on your color team of plant containers. Get innovative and creative and let your imagination run wild. If you do not want to invest or spend too much you could use old containers or boxes and get your hands dirty with some cool acrylic paints to make your own designs and patterns on your containers.  \n\n4. Seeds\n\nGet your hands on some good quality seeds to grow some amazing vegetables and herbs. Probably, you could start off with some tomatoes, coriander and chilly at first and then move on to some other vegetables. \n\n5. Pesticides\n\nWhere there are plants there are pests! So make sure to take care of your plants using natural pesticides rather than the dangerous artificial ones. These could be prepared at home itself, so you do not have to worry much about it. \n\nNow that you know how to get started with your very own garden, go ahead and work your mind away to setup your superb terrace garden right away!\n\n', '1542782062'),

A place which witnesses all good and bad phases of your life, emotions, family bondings, ups and downs, and to sum it all your entire life. To have a warm welcoming home is something which everyone looks forward to. \nTo have it all, people buy fanciest of houses in posh localities with all comforts in there. But what we forget is its not the luxury which makes our life comfortable, itâ€™s the relationships which make you feel like coming back everyday. \nThe foremost thing which transforms a house into a home is the relationship which its family members share with each other. Doesnâ€™t matter if one is living with a family or with friends, the feeling of love, patience, adjustments and respect creates a positive aura worth liveable. It nurtures the relationships and thus home. \nThe sounds of laughter at the dinner table, the feelings of cozyness on the coffeetables, the sense of togetherness while watching TV and belonginess while going through rough time is all which makes a house a home. \nHome sweet home! â€“ something which we all have heard one or the other time when we enter the home after a long day of work or even after a long vacation. The reason home is sweet because it defines us. It makes us complete. Our own small world which shares our moods, and tempers. The way the family members stick to each other in good and tough times, the way they care for each other is all that transform a house into a home!\nIt gives you the comfort of a mother, shelter like a father, belongingness of siblings and comfort of friends. A house is a home when you have feelings and memories attached to it. When you feel it defined by it, when it adds to your character. This all happens when you nurture the relationships it carries with is. \nAfter all home sweet home is sweet when you feel good to be at home! \n', '1542785060'),

Of course, the city skyline looks great on your Instagram profile, and there\'s something poetic about gazing at those high-rises from your window during a long day at the office. But the concrete jungle can be overwhelming when you haven\'t had a breath of fresh air in ages. For sometime now, a number of city-dwellers have attempted to change this buy growing gardens in their own apartments. Not only do these grant a certain aesthetic appeal to what inevitably becomes a concrete mess, but it\'s a great way to ensure that you enjoy a breath of fresh air without having to escape the city life that you can\'t do without anymore. That said, here are a few tips to keep in mind if you\'re considering creating your own terrace garden:\n\nBE READY TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY\n\nHey, no one said gardening was going to be a walk in the park (no pun intended). Gardening takes a lot of investment. Aside from setting aside at least an hour for your day, you need to adapt a little to the outdoors. That means sticking your hand in the mud, probably getting the occasional insect bite, and of course a  lot of time and effort. You reap what you sow after all. \n\nGETTING DOWN TO WORK\n\nYou need to ensure that you\'re waterproofing is intact lest you face the scorn of your neighbours. You also need a steady supply of seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, and water to keep your garden intact. And you need to monitor these every single day to obtain the best result. \n\nMANAGING THE PESTS\n\nOnce your garden is done, it\'s likely that insects may want a slice of the cake. Although the best way to deal with this is organically, these may not be the most feasible. Investing in some pest management solutions may be a good idea. It would also help to invest in a good wire mesh or nylon wires to keep away birds and squirrels.\n', '1542792638'),

Alternatively, you can make a bed of soil directly on your roof surface, though this will require painstaking attention to waterproofing and water drainage on the roof slab. Next, you need to design a layout of the garden keeping in mind areas which are mostly shiny throughout the day and those which remain shaded. Now, make up your mind about the various plants you want to grow. Fibre rooted plants are a better choice here over deep rooted plants which need more depth of soil. Whichever ones you choose, take care to appropriately put the plants according to the sunshine that falls in differrnt areas on your roof. The type of soil you will need for the pots should also be chosen according to the plants you are going to grow. \n\nAfter laying hands on all the entities - containers, pots, seeds, water vessels etc. - you need to now start gardening.

However, his flamboyant, often self-praising verses had created quite a stir in the minds of the impressionable Indian youth. While the essence of rap lyrics come out best when the rapper is blatant, outspoken and not mincing his words while talking about his life, Singhâ€™s lyrics had a peculiar charm that spoke mainly of his drinking capacity, his penchant for dark-skinned women or fancy cars. Lines such as chaar botal vodka, kaam mera roz ka is amusing because the rapper comes across as an obnoxious man who clearly has a drinking problem but also takes immense pride in his condition. The kind of influence his lyrics have on the youth is debatable but they sure are entertaining. Singhâ€™s famous Lungi Dance is another example of how nonsensical he can get if needed but the same time he will make sure that the utter gibberish will top the charts for months to come.

But, terrace gardens are creating a new buzz in the life of a cosmopolitan today!\nAs the word self-describes it, they are mainly outdoor gardens re-created in the balconies, windows, porches and preferably terrace of an individual.

House is a basic structure where people can take a shelter. but we cannot say house as home until people live there as a family. The essence to become house a home is to love, care, kindness and compassion among the family members. You might be thinking that it is common in every family what is new in it. Are you confident about it? The basic thing to get all these in the family is to be with each other. To give time to each other. In this smartphone era, we are so much busy in the social life that we hardly give time to the person sitting across us. We are everywhere through the social platform like facebook, snapchat, Instagram; except in our house. Now we don\'t go to family picnics, we do not go to the park with children, we hardly sit together or eat together like people use to. Today, we don\'t know what to talk to each other without involving our phones. Our homes lack togetherness. Our houses are crying to heard the laughs and chats at the time of family dinners. Our home urging us for the family get-togethers. Nowadays, we are communicating with the world but we lack the channel of communication in our own houses. Living together does not means you are together. Communication and sharing are very necessary to bring the family together, to make a house a home. So, from today onward, we should make a pact to give more time to our family than the social media. Our family will listen to our thoughts verbally and not through Facebook or Twitter. We see the photographs together in a living room but not on each other Instagram page. Let\'s make our house home again.\n', '1542807664'),

It can be anything from mathematics to music, psychology to painting, biology to spirituality. An educated person is one who has insight, knowledge, wisdom,  and clarity to use knowledge in the right direction. \nUnfortunately, education across the globe, specially in India, has been restricted as only a passage to jobs and salary packages. The education system in India is in deep crisis. The last Indian to receive a noble prize was Amartya  Sen, in 1998. Indian research institutions have a very poor global standing, Indian Institute of Sciences, Bengaluru, is the only Indian institute in the top 100 institutes for research. There are hardly people who opt for PhDs in India, and among those very few remain in the country and contribute. Why is it that we are lagging behind in research? Well, one reason is lack of government support. There are very few institutes in India which are dedicated completely to research. There are not proper equipments or facilities and the pay for a research scholar is extremely poor as compared to other countries. Second reason is weak education system. The education system in India is structured in a way, or has become like this, that emphasises on grades and I entrance exams, rather than just education. The population is very large and the institutions are very few,  and then there is reservation. All of this leads to heavy competition, due to which students end up fighting for grades and seats, rather than cherishing knowledge. Third factor is the society. The two above mentioned factors have shaped the Indian society in a way which puts too much pressure on children. It leaves children in an emotional and mental turmoil, and most of them never even try to discover what they truly enjoy. This is an egregious situation for the country, as the number of PhD enrollments have declined but suicide rate has increased. \nThis is a vicious cycle of study, marks, and jobs. Is PhD really worth in India? \nIt depends on you. If you want to study, not for money or jobs, but just for the fun of it, to gain knowledge and fall in love with a particular field, then you should go for it. But one should also keep in mind that the present society and education system will not let it be as easy as it would be in other countries. ', '1542873776'),

Want to get away with the most dreaded part of pregnancy -  the delivery?\nWe all experience a multitude of feelings as the time approaches. It is only natural to feel a tad jittery.\n\nHereâ€™s a list of Dos and Donts to help you sail through this journey to motherhood.\n\nDos \n\nExercise: Keep doing those Kegel exercises that your doctor has suggested. Keep working â€“ be it office work or household chores. Pregnancy is the most natural phenomenon and it doesnâ€™t have to change your lifestyle.\n\nBaby Essentials: Take stock of baby essentials like clothing, crib, car seat, diapers, feeding bottles, some basic medicines like nasal care or colic pain reliever. Keep your hospital bag ready. \nStay Positive and Strong: You are passing your thoughts and vibes to your baby in the womb so watch them. Pamper yourself. Try to read books or watch programs that are inspirational and induce happy thoughts.\n\nTalk to your firstborn: If you have a firstborn, talk to her. Build some excitement on how interesting it would be to have an additional member in the family. Engage your child in the task of bringing up the baby â€“ delegate some activities. Also, it is an important time to address any emotional queries that your child might have. If your child is not willing to talk â€“ be proactive. Let her know how much you love her.\n\nEat healthy: Keep it light and healthy. Continue taking those supplements and superfoods.\n\nEnjoy: This time would never come back again, so donâ€™t forget to enjoy and be thankful.\n\nDonts\n\nStress â€“ Motherhood is instinctive. Donâ€™t overburden yourself with negative thoughts. Keep distance from people who create an unnecessary scare. Mother has been glorified for a reason because she knows the best for the baby. Only you can manage your baby and no one else so brace yourself and savor the last few days of peaceful sleep.\n\nImpatient: You canâ€™t get impatient now. I know your back hurts and you are tired of carrying that baby weight around but keep going. Donâ€™t let irritation take away the pleasure of being a mother. \n\nExert â€“ While it is important to go about doing your business as usual. It is imperative to know when to stop. If you feel that you donâ€™t have the energy to do a task â€“ please donâ€™t do it. Be wary of your sitting and sleeping postures. Refrain from sudden movements. Your actions could have an impact on your babyâ€™s health so be mindful.\nHope you find these suggestions to be useful. Please share your thoughts and experiences.\n\nHappy Delivery ðŸ˜Š\n\n', '1542980068'),
